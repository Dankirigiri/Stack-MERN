# Stack-MERN

This is a paractice-page using MySQL, Express, React and NodeJS (MERN), only with educative purposes.
The frameworks used in this practice page are Express, Axios for backend and Formik for frontend, and the inspiration to this page is the video "stack MERN with MySQL" from the youtuber Fazt (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJbd7BYofp4&t=4680s&ab_channel=FaztCode).


Beside, I'm using the PlanetScape's databases for this practice page. Finally, I also included TailwindCSS for more styles on the page.
